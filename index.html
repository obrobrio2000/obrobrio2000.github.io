			Hi, my name is <b>Giovanni Magliocchetti</b>.
			<br><br>
			I was born and raised in Ceccano, and then moved to Rome to begin my University studies. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in "Computer Science and Automation Engineering", specializing in the former. My desire since I was born is to become a Software Engineer, but I'm passionate about every single thing regarding computer science and technology. In fact, not only I'm interested in software, mobile and web development, but also in subjects like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and CyberSecurity, which are becoming continuosly important in our everyday lives. I have a passion for all things creative, and I'm always looking to create meaningful experiences and memorable stories. 
			<br><br>
			I'm currently working on two personal projects: the first one is a small and simple Android app which enhances performance and battery saving on Samsung Android devices, the second one... is top secret (I can only say that it is about AI)!
			<br><br>
			When I'm not thinking in code or pixels, I love playing football and exercising, getting involved in teaching programs, travelling, and spending time with my friends.
